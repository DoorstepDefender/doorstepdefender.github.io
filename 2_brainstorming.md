## Magnet Box!
* Packages would be equipped with a metal plate. Upon contacting the magnet box, the pad will recognize that a package was placed, and will activate. ​
* Upon unrightful removal, a mechanism would be triggered, using some form of deterrent suchlike loud noise. ​
* __Con:__ Lacks the ability to hide the package and effectively stop the porch pirate​.

## One-Way Chute
* Chute system on the porch to swallow packages​.
* Take them to basement?
* Chute would use flaps to make it one-way​.
* __Con:__ Exposes basement to possible intruders and difficult to install​.

## Package-Detecting Pad
* A pad activated by a sensor hooked to an integrated chip, that registers whenever a package is placed. ​
* If package is removed without deactivation, speaker unit will turn on.​
* Other sensors may be applied, suchlike a time-of-flight (ToF) sensor, force-sensitive resistor, or retroreflective sensor​.
* __Con:​__ May not be able to fully prevent theft or package​.
