## Problem Statement
We aim to address the issue of porch piracy that inflicts significant financial losses on individuals and companies. ​These financial losses have led to decreased potential for companies and customer satisfaction. ​Current preventative measures have proven inadequate.​ Doorstep Defender seeks to develop a product which would minimize theft, restore confidence in online purchases, and protect both parties from financial or product loss. ​

## Design Statement
We have 14 weeks to design, build, and test a system/product to protect packages from thieves. We have access to purchase $50 of materials and other materials openly available in the school, suchlike plywood, screws, and plastics. ​We have access to various tools, suchlike basic tools (ex. Screwdrivers), bandsaw, and 3D printers. ​
